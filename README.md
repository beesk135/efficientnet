# EfficientNet

EfficientNet implementation in PyTorch.

EfficientNets are a family of models with much better accuracy and efficiency compared to existing models.
Generally they use an order of magnitude fewer parameters and floating point operations per second compared to existing models with similar accuracy.
For more information see the provided resources below.
